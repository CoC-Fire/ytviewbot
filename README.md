# ytviewbot
YouTube View Bot: will be configured a list of video url's, and a time range to watch another video from the list after a random amount of time
Long description: when downloaded, a config file will be made which will contain the time range plus other possible future config options, and a list file containing the video urls.
Repo edit dates and notes will be provided after here, and when the bot is somewhat operational, I will provide a operation instructions file.
